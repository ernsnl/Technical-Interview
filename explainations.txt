Question 1
------------------
Anagrams are the rearrangement of the letters in a word. In this question,
best way to find is counting the  letters occurrence in both words. After occurrence is equal or less,
we are sure that substring is an anagram.

Question 2
-------------------
Manacher's algorithm is designed to find a longest palindromic string in given string.
In the implementation, boundaries start from the edges of the string and shortens with each iteration.
First looks 0 n-1, and 1 n
Then shortens it 0 n-2, 1 n-1, and 2 n
So on and so forth.

Question 3
-------------------
There are popular algorithms for minimum spanning tree; Prim's and Kruskal's algorithm.
In this question, Prim's Algorithm is chosen. Prims algorithm is based on the minimum edge values. It can start
from any where in the graph. For convenience, it starts from the first node.

Question 4
-------------------
Using Binary Search Tree property that if a value is bigger than the compared node place it on the right.
If it is smaller than compared node placed it on the left. We can iterate over whole the until they are on the
different sides. We can find the solution with one iteration if the tree.

Question 5
-------------------
We are given a linked list starting node but we do not know the length of the list. First we need to calculate
the length, then based on that value we can find the requested node.
